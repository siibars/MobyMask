# MobyMask

A lightweight, viral invite-based phishing report system with accountability and revocation. Available at [https://mobymask.com](https://mobymask.com).

Based on the [Delegatable Eth](https://github.com/danfinlay/delegatable-eth) framework for making counterfactually mintable soulbound tokens (or off chain delegations).

## Workflow

Various components can be found in the `packages` folder.
- `hardhat` contains the solidity and its tests.
- `server` includes a server that could eventually index the results, and generates root-level invitation links.
- `react-app` contains the front-end.
- `js-eth-delegatable-utils` is a JS utility I made for more easily and reliably making signatures in the Astral format.
- `extension` is the beginnings of a browser extension that could flag phishers on Twitter. It is able to add a badge to people, but does not yet have a data source.

# Delegatable

An abstract solidity contract that any contract can easily integrate to add a ton of improvements to that contract's user and developer experience for all of its functions:
- Allow users to sign "invocations" instead of transactions, which bring lots of benefits.
- Invocations bring the full user-readability of [signTypedData](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html#sign-typed-data-v4) for all of that app's operations.
- Support for MetaTransactions
- Support for batched operations: Many actions in one transaction, and potentially lower gas costs.
- Support for signing multiple actions that aren't blocked by each other, so an urgent transaction isn't blocked by the low nonce of a low-stakes low-gas bid transaction.
- Support for signing commitments that can be lazily submitted to the blockchain later.
- Allow users to sign offchain messages that delegate authority to perform any action they can perform, along with an open-ended system for adding restrictions to that delegation, including revocation.
- Allow the holder of any delegation to issue a delegation from it, also with an off-chain signature and no up-front gas.
- Allows creating invite links to users who don't have accounts set up yet, by signing delegations to a key you send to them.

You can read about [the theory behind this library here](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/capabul/page/cnW_23H8w).

## Integration in a Solidity project

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "./Delegatable.sol";

contract YourContract is Delegatable {

  constructor(string memory name) Delegatable(name, "1") {}

  function _msgSender () internal view override(Delegatable, Context) returns (address sender) {
    if(msg.sender == address(this)) {
      bytes memory array = msg.data;
      uint256 index = msg.data.length;
      assembly {
        // Load the 32 bytes word from memory with the address on the lower 20 bytes, and mask those.
        sender := and(mload(add(array, index)), 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)
      }
    } else {
      sender = msg.sender;
    }
    return sender;
  }

}
```

To use this in your own contract, follow these simple steps:
- inherit your contract from [contracts/Delegatable.sol](./packages/hardhat/contracts/Delegatable.sol).
- Your constructor will need to pass the `Delegatable` class a name for your contract, and a version string, per [EIP 712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712).
- Add our sample `_msgSender()` method to your contract, as seen in [our sample contract](./packages/hardhat/contracts/YourContract.sol).
- If you are inheriting from any contracts that use `msg.sender` to identify a user, you should now use the `_msgSender()` method instead, to benefit from this framework. Conveniently, it seems that most [OpenZeppelin libraries](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) already use an internal `_msgSender()` implementation, and so overriding it as shown should be enough to use those libraries.

## Integration into a web frontend

These contracts should be compatible with any signer or wallet that supports [signTypedData_v4, like MetaMask](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html#sign-typed-data-v4).

You will be calling the `eth_signTypedData` method with the `V4` parameter, as seen in [the test files](./packages/hardhat/test/myTest.js).

## How it's set up

A fork of Scaffold-ETH boilerplate

Currently most of the good stuff is going on in `packages/hardhat`.

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```
NB : for node 18 do mind doing this before start
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```
> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
